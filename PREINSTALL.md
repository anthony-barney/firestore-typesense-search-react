Use this extension to sync data from your Firestore collection to [Typesense](https://typesense.org/), to be able to 
do full-text fuzzy search on your Firestore data.

This extension listens to your specified Firestore collection and syncs Firestore documents to Typesense 
on creation, updates and deletes. It also provides a function to help you backfill data.

#### Additional setup

Before installing this extension, make sure that you have:

1. [Set up a Cloud Firestore database](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/quickstart) in your Firebase project.
2. [Setup](https://typesense.org/docs/0.20.0/guide/install-typesense.html) a Typesense cluster 
  (on [Typesense Cloud](https://cloud.typesense.org) or a Self-Hosted server).
3. Setup a Typesense Collection either through the Typesense Cloud dashboard or 
  through the [API](https://typesense.org/docs/0.20.0/api/collections.html#create-a-collection).

This extension will sync changes that happen _after_ you've installed the extension. You'll be able to run a function 
to backfill existing data in your Firestore collection. Detailed information for running this backfill function 
will be provided after you install this extension.
